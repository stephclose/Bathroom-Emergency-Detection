This system is composed of integrated embedded subsystems, each for the purpose of detection and response:

- **ðŸšª Door Sensor**  
  Monitors door activity to detect entry and occupancy status based on open/close events.

- **ðŸŽ¯ Motion Sensor**  
  Detects movement within the room to assess whether someone is present or inactive for an extended time.

- **ðŸ“Ÿ Pager Unit**  
  Wirelessly alerts staff ensuring discreet and immediate notification.

- **ðŸ§  Main MCU Controller**  
  Coordinates communication between sensors and the pager system and manages system states.

## Emergency Logic Flow

1. **Normal State**: Motion + door sensor data monitored continuously.
2. **Potential Emergency Detected**:  
   - Door is closed  
   - No motion for threshold duration  
   - Triggers buzzer + LED for 15 seconds
3. **User Response Window**:  
   - If reset button is pressed â†’ system resets  
   - If not â†’ pager receives alert
4. **Manual Emergency**:  
   - Emergency button bypasses logic, sends alert instantly
5. **Pager Response**:  
   - Staff press acknowledge button  
   - Confirmation sent back via LoRa

### Build Instructions

1. Install [PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/install)
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Bathroom-Emergency-Detection.git
   cd Bathroom-Emergency-Detection
> To build and flash code, **navigate into the specific subsystem directory** (`doorSensor/`, `pager/`, or `main_mcu/`).  
> **PlatformIO does not work from the top-level repo directory!**
